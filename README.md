Hi, I’m Siddhi.

I build practical data and machine learning solutions rooted in research.
Explore my projects below, and feel free to connect!

## Project

## 📄 Semantic Document Retrieval. 
  ### 🔗 [View on GitHub](https://github.com/rawoolsiddhi/Efficient-Doc-Retrieval-Storage)
      
 A document retrieval system that uses a hybrid model combining TF-IDF-based Vector Space Modeling (VSM) with Single-Link Hierarchical Clustering to semantically group and rank documents based on query similarity.
  It features a minimal Streamlit interface for uploading, searching, and visualizing clustered results, with MongoDB used for document metadata management.
  The methods and approach implemented in this project are detailed in a research paper authored by us and published in IEEE.

**SentimentFusions** is a full-stack product review analyzer that scrapes real-world reviews, processes them using machine learning, and displays a sentiment dashboard with keyword insights and rating trends — all on a single interface.  
Built for fast, reliable customer opinion mining across any product or category.


## 3. 💳 Fraud Transaction Detection
   ### 🔗 [View on GitHub](https://github.com/rawoolsiddhi/fraud_transaction_detection)
   
 An end-to-end machine learning project to detect fraudulent financial transactions using a stacking ensemble model (Random Forest + XGBoost).
It includes preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, prediction, and a user-friendly Streamlit web app.


## 4.🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis and Dashboard
   ### 🔗 [View on GitHub](https://github.com/rawoolsiddhi/Zomato-Data-Analysis)

 An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on restaurant data from Zomato in Karnataka, India.
