Hi, I’m Siddhi.

I build practical data and machine learning solutions rooted in research.
Explore my projects below, and feel free to connect!


## Project

## 1. 📄 Semantic Document Retrieval using Single-Link Clustering and Vector Space Models
      ### 🔗 [View on GitHub](https://github.com/rawoolsiddhi/Efficient-Doc-Retrieval-Storage)
      
 A document retrieval system that uses a hybrid model combining TF-IDF-based Vector Space Modeling (VSM) with Single-Link Hierarchical Clustering to semantically group and rank documents based on query similarity.
It features a minimal Streamlit interface for uploading, searching, and visualizing clustered results, with MongoDB used for document metadata management.

The methods and approach implemented in this project are detailed in a research paper authored by us and published in IEEE.
